  OpenEdgeStack SX126x – Polymorphic Stream Transmit Example

  This example demonstrates how to send **large encrypted LoRa messages**
  using the SX126x module family when a button is pressed.

  Using the new **PolymorphicLoraSender** class, messages exceeding the
  typical LoRa payload limit (>200 bytes) are automatically split into
  chunks and sent sequentially as a stream. The receiver can reassemble
  the full message using the STREAM_END identifier.

  Features:
  - Data is encrypted using the AppSKey before transmission.
  - Messages larger than 200 bytes are split into 200-byte chunks.
  - Each chunk is encrypted and sent using the existing session system.
  - A final chunk includes a STREAM_END marker to indicate end-of-stream.
  - Polymorphism ensures a single runtime instance can send the entire stream.
  - Designed for continuous transmission without requiring ACK handling.

  Packet Format:
    [SenderID (8 bytes)] + [Nonce (16 bytes)] + [Encrypted Payload] + [HMAC (8 bytes)]

  Requirements:
  - RadioLib library.
  - LoRa module: SX126x (tested with Heltec V3).

  Optional:
  - SPIFFS mounted for session persistence.

  Notes:
  - Uploading without valid keys will result in a compile error.
  - Each device must be provisioned with unique cryptographic keys.
  - Keys can be generated using:
      1) Provided Python script `generate_keys.py` in 'extras' folder.
         Produces C-style arrays ready to copy into this sketch.
      2) The Things Network (TTN) – generate device credentials manually.

  Usage:
  - Press the configured button to send the large payload.
  - The entire payload is transmitted as a continuous stream to the receiver.
  - No ACK handling; ensure the receiver can process full streams.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  IMPORTANT: Uploading a sketch without valid keys will result in a compile error.
  
  The key arrays below have been intentionally commented out to prevent the
  use of default or weak keys. This measure ensures that users must provide
  unique and secure keys before compiling.

  Each device must be provisioned with its own cryptographic keys to
  securely communicate over LoRa.

  You have two options for generating these keys:

  1) Use the provided Python script `generate_keys.py` located in the 'extras' folder.
     This script outputs keys as C-style arrays ready to be copied here.
     Rember the app and hmacKey get shared between devices.
     Use gatewayEUI in the python script as the secnd devEUI or vice versa.

  2) Use The Things Network (TTN) to generate compatible device credentials,
     then manually paste those values into the arrays below.
